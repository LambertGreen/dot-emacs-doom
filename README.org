#+TITLE:   README

This is my =Doom Emacs= configuration.

* Introduction
I am =Vim= user who was looking for a better interface for software development for taking notes, planning, and switching programming modes, and found that =Emacs= provides this while having an excellent =Vim= emulation.  In particular the =Doom Emacs= configuration implements all the goodies that I was looking for.

* Highlights
** =Evil=
+ I am not sure I would bother with =Emacs= if there was no support for =Vim= based text editing.
+ =Doom Emacs= fills in some of the small gaps in =evil= and =evil-collection=
** =Org=
+ Nothing else quite like this.
+ I use this for my notes, project planning, and agenda (this very file is an =org-mode= file)
** =Magit=
+ Excellent Git interface.
** =LSP=
+ Makes =Emacs= my primary IDE.

#+TITLE:   README

This is my =Doom Emacs= configuration.

* Introduction
I am =Vim= user who was looking for a better interface for software development for taking notes, planning, and switching programming modes, and found that =Emacs= provides this while having an excellent =Vim= emulation.  However in particular the =Doom Emacs= configuration implements all the goodies that I was looking for.

+ Highlights
  + =Evil=
    + I am not sure I would bother with =Emacs= if there was no support for =Vim= based text editing.
  + =Org-Mode=
    + Nothing else quite like this. I use this for my notes, project planning, and agenda
  + =Magit=
    + Excellent Git interface. Much better than the command-line interface
  + =Lsp-mode=
    + Makes =Emacs= my primary IDE.
